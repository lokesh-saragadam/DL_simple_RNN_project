ðŸ“Œ IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Classifier
A deep learning project that classifies IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model is trained on 50,000 reviews, automatically split into training and testing sets by the Keras dataset module. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of sequence modeling for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

It uses word embeddings to represent the input text, applies pre-padding for uniform sequence length, and employs a Simple RNN with one hidden layer. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
